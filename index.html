            <p><img src="assets/images/anthony.jpeg" style="margin-right: 15px" align="left" height="150" alt="Anthony's Pic">I have been in the IT industry for almost 10 years and have 6 years of sales and recruiting experience. After recruiting technical consultants for one year, I transitioned into the business development and client management role. I enjoy building long term relationships with clients, as well as identifying and helping to resolve their needs and challenges. The most fulfilling parts of the job are making sure the client is happy, helping them find the best people, and helping candidates find their perfect career.<br><br>I like spending most of my time outdoors. My hobbies include hiking, camping, off-roading and watching baseball. I try to spend as much time as I can with my family and friends.</p>
